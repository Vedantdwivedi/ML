I was born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, yet somehow I remained totally oblivious to the entire field of computer science until I travelled to a small college-town in the Berkshires. There, by chance, I became good friends with a CS major eager to share his excitement and knowledge about the field. 
As soon as I could understand what he was talking about, I became hooked. 4 years later, in those rare moments when I find myself not on a computer I greatly enjoy travelling (see below photos), playing sports (especially Volleyball and Basketball), spending time outdoors (hiking, swimming, body surfing, etc...), and talking about literature and philosophy.
